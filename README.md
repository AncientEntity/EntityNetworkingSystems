# EntityNetworkingSystems
 A networking framework for Unity.


I have tried many different networking systems for Unity. None have come to my liking so I will be coming together, to make one that seems to work.

I am mainly using this for my project at https://epocria.net

## Important Features
- Packet Sending Backbone (Complete)
- Instantiating/Destroying GameObjects over the network (Complete)
- Player authority over an object. (Complete)
- Network Fields, automatically get synced. (Complete)
- RPC with Arguments (Complete)
- Steamworks Integration (Inprogress)
- Namespaces & Unity Package Release (Last)

## Extras
- Buffered Packet Culling (Soon)
- Documentation & Videos (Soon)

## Requirements
- Unity 2019 or above. (It hasn't been tested on Unity 2018, but I assume it should be fine)
