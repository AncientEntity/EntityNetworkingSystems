# EntityNetworkingSystems
 A networking framework for Unity.


I have tried many different networking systems for Unity. None have come to my liking so I will be coming together, to make one that seems to work.

I am mainly using this for my project at https://epocria.net

## Contributing
Contributing in anyway possible means a lot. If you see something you can improve, something you want added, or just want to do some documentation make a branch then let me know through GitHub when it is ready! As well as if you want to communicate with me, I am using this for my game "Epocria" which has a Discord server I can be contacted through: https://discord.gg/vkxmjrx

## Requirements & License
- Unity 2019 or above. (It hasn't been tested on Unity 2018, but I assume it should be fine)
- If using Steamworks you need Facepunch.Steamworks avaliable here: https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks and under the MIT license as well.
